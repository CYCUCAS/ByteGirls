# ByteGirls: A Next-Generation Fragmented Knowledge Media Platform Based on Large Language Models

Share your chats with large language models! Discover your interests in the recommended chats! At ByteGirls, you can understand yourself more clearly! ByteGirls uses conversational interactions with large language models as its core content, integrating recommendation systems to build a fragmented knowledge media platform tailored for women.

Existing popular large language model applications are isolated islands, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Doubao, Kimi, DeepSeek, etc. All of them require users to actively interact with the large language models, turning these applications into mere tools rather than communities. If users have no questions, don’t need to write code, process documents, translate English papers... then they won’t open these apps. ByteGirls aims to break down the isolation between user groups in AI applications, creating a fragmented knowledge community for women to share chat records with large language models. This allows the knowledge, thoughts, and art generated by large language models to flow freely, influencing every user who is interested.

P.S. When running the web application, modify your large model API settings in the app.py file, then enter export ARK_API_KEY="Enter your API key here" && python app.py in the terminal.
